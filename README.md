# ScheduledReboot

## What is it ?

This script enables you to schedule a restart of a PC or a server at a wanted time.

## How it works ?

When the script is launched, it asks you to set the day of reboot (0 for today, 1 for tomorrow, 2 for after-tomorrow, etc...).
It asks you to set the hour too.
Default : today at 4 AM.
The time must be formatted as a decimal number (2 for 2:00 ; 14,5 for 14:30).

## How to use it ?

2 ways are available : the ps1 (powershell file), or the executable file.
Both are doing the same, but the display is different.
